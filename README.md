Jabberwalk Audiobook Player

Jabberwalk is my attempt at creating an audiobook player that I would want to use.
At work I listen to audiobooks for most of my 12 hour shift, so I go through them pretty quickly and use different apps a lot.
After being frustrated with the current competition for a year or so I decided to try and make my own. I wanted to go for an aesthetic that was a mix between
Audible and Google Play Music. Something you could navigate quickly and easily, but still have all of the features you'd want in 
an audiobook player. This project, like most of mine, ended up being way more complex than I initially
imagined.

As of right now the code isn't commented, but that's a work in progress. There are also a lot of things structurally speaking that I would
change if I were to redesign this app from the ground up, but overall I'm proud of the result.
